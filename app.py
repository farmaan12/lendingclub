**_Important Information:_**

- After checking the datasets and performing eda with two famous libraries we were able to understand that this dataset had almost 49% columns with null values which is not beneficial further, hence these columns were removed for further analysis.
- We also have to take csre of the null columns in future and fill them accordingly as per business purposes to see if we can drive more insights out of the data which is null at the moment.
- Below we can see a visual representation to see how the data is filled with null values.

**_Summary:_**

- Most of the loans issued were in the range of 10,000 to 20,000 usd.
- The year of 2015 was the year were most loans were issued.
- Loans were issued in an incremental manner.
- The loans applied by potential borrowers, the amount issued to the borrowers and the amount funded by investors are similarly distributed, meaning that it is most likely that qualified borrowers are going to get the loan they had applied for.

**_The top 3 purposes are:_**

- 56.5% of the Loans are to Debt Consolidation.
- 22.87% are to pay Credit Card.
- 6.67% are to buy a Home.
- Thus we can conclude that the person who applies for such purposes on the website is more likely to drive revenue for the organization in terms of sales.

**_A Deeper Look into Bad Loans:_**

What we need to know: The number of loans that were classified as bad loans for each region by its loan status. (This will be shown in a dataframe below.) This won't give us the exact reasons why a loan is categorized as a bad loan (other variables that might have influence the condition of the loan) but it will give us a deeper insight on the level of risk in a particular region.

**_Summary:_**

- The regions of the West and SouthEast had a higher percentage in most of the b "bad" loan statuses.
- The NorthEast region had a higher percentage in Grace Period and Does not meet Credit Policy loan status. However, both of these are not considered as bad as default for instance. 
- Based on this small and brief summary we can conclude that the West and SouthEast regions have the most undesirable loan status, but just by a slightly higher percentage compared to the NorthEast region.
- Again, this does not tell us what causes a loan to be a bad loan , but it gives us some idea about the level of risk within the regions across the United States.

- Top Experience employees plot describes the experience of employees which tells us that there are many eligible customers who can drive more business to our company.

**_Important Information to increase revenue with the help of data:_**

- Company have to collect the data from website which provides information stating engagement time of the customer which will help us to understand what is the best time to contact guest to drive a sale and revenue to the company.
- We have to fill null values with some meaningful information so we can analyse and gain more insights out of the data.
- Website traffic data can help us reach out to potential employee who requires a loan and increase in our sales and revenue.
- There are many other factors which can be driven from the data to make more helpful decisions in future.
