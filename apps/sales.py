**_Summary:_**
- Most of the loans issued were in the range of 10,000 to 20,000 usd.
- The year of 2015 was the year were most loans were issued.
- Loans were issued in an incremental manner.
- The loans applied by potential borrowers, the amount issued to the borrowers and the amount funded by investors are similarly distributed, meaning that it is most likely that qualified borrowers are going to get the loan they had applied for.

**_The top 3 purposes are:_**
- 56.5% of the Loans are to Debt Consolidation.
- 22.87% are to pay Credit Card.
- 6.67% are to buy a Home.
